## What does this do?

Sunbird Scanner is a custom built tool to scrape GoFundMe campaigns using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), and then reports campaign stats to a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) table.

## Features

- Uses a loader script to support multiple tables
- Loads links directly from tables, using Supabase API
- Performant and fast
- Cross-platform
- Supports both Chuffed and GoFundMe


## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up the project. No prior experience is necessaryâ€”just follow the instructions below!

---

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your computer:

- **Git**: A tool to clone and manage the project code.
- **Node.js**: A platform for running JavaScript code.
- **Supabase Account**: A backend-as-a-service platform where you'll set up your database.

---

### Step 1: Install Git

Git is a tool that helps you download and manage the project code.

1. Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Download the version for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the default setup options.
4. After installation, open a terminal and type `git --version` to confirm Git is installed.

---

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.

1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version.
3. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions. Ensure the option to install `npm` (Node Package Manager) is checked.
4. After installation, open a terminal and type `node --version` and `npm --version` to confirm installation.

---

### Step 3: Clone the Project Repository

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you'd like to store the project:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
3. Run the following command to clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sneethan/sunbird_scanner
   ```
4. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sunbird_scanner
   ```

---

### Step 4: Install Node Modules

Node modules are libraries the project needs to work.

1. In the project folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will download and set up everything needed.

### Step 5: Set Up a Supabase Database

Supabase is a service that provides a database and API for your project.

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new project:
   - Enter a project name.
   - Choose a database region close to you.
   - Set a database password (keep this safe!).
3. Once the project is created, go to the "Table Editor" tab.
4. Create a new table with the following schema:

| Column Name | Data Type | Default | Constraints           |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------------------|
| `id`        | `int4`    | `auto`  | Primary Key           |
| `title`     | `text`    |         |                       |
| `link`      | `text`    |         |                       |
| `currency`  | `text`    |         |                       |
| `target`    | `int4`    |         |                       |
| `raised`    | `int4`    |         |                       |
| `donations` | `int4`    |         |                       |
| `updated_at`| `timestampz`| `now()`| Automatically Updated |

5. Save the table.

---

### Step 6: Get Your Supabase API Keys

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API**.
2. Copy the **`Project URL`** and **`Anon Key`**.
3. Leave this page open, and paste the values into your terminal when requested. ``run.js`` will ask for them automatically.

---

### You're Ready to Go!

Now, you have everything set up. Run your project using:
```bash
node run.js
```
